              This is a popular alternative to &lsquo;traditional burial.&rsquo;
              In a green burial, a body is placed in its natural state (no
              embalming) into a biodegradable casket or natural fiber shroud.
              The body is then placed directly into the earth, allowing it to
              decompose naturally. Green burials are legal in all 50 US states,
              though there are some regulations around where they can take
              place. Many states have green burial cemeteries or &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo;
              cemeteries which offer both traditional and green burials.

              <span className="font-medium text-ch">Traditional Burial:</span>{" "}
              A traditional burial may include embalming (where blood is drained
              from a body and replaced with formaldehyde or other chemicals for
              preservation), a casket (wooden, metal, other) and a grave is
              generally lined with concrete (forming the burial vault) before
              the body is laid to rest. Temporarily delays decomposition,
              keeping the body intact for several days or up to a week.

              urban areas, where green cemeteries and natural burial may not be
              readily available. In this process, bodies are laid to rest within
              a closed vessel along with organic material (such as straw,
              alfalfa and wood chips) to transform into nutrient-rich soil over
              several weeks. The soil can then be returned to loved ones to be

            <p>
              While laws around the transport and disposition of human bodies
              varies by state, there is a federal Funeral Rule in place to
              protect the consumer who is planning and paying for a funeral.
              These rules exist to protect people from unfair upselling and
              unclear pricing structures at a funeral home and are enforced by
              the Federal Trade Commission. The Funeral Rule makes it possible
              for you to choose only the goods and services from a funeral home
              that you want or need. The rule allows you to compare prices
              between funeral homes and makes it possible to select arrangements
              you want to use for a home funeral. In short, you do not have to
              buy a package, and you do not have to use a funeral home if you
              prefer a home funeral.
            </p>
            <p>The US Funeral Rule gives you the right to:</p>

                You have a protected right to buy separate goods (such as
                caskets) and services (such as embalming or a memorial service).
                You do not have to accept a package that includes any items you
                do not want.

                Funeral directors are required to give you pricing information
                over the telephone if you ask for it, and you do not need to
                give them your name, telephone number or address first. Some
                funeral homes will mail their price lists, and some post them
                online.

                The funeral home must give you a General Price List that is yours

                It can be overwhelming to shop for a casket. Funerals must

                great place to start &ndash; you can see this list before you see

                Outer burial containers, such as concrete vaults lining a grave,
                are not required by state law anywhere in the U.S., but many
                cemeteries require them to prevent the grave from caving in

                sells containers, but doesn&apos;t list their prices on the
                general price list, you have the right to look at a separate
                container price list before you see the containers. If you
                don&apos;t see the lower-priced containers listed, ask about
                them.

                This statement should show exactly what you are buying and the

                You may use an alternative container. No state or local law
                requires the use of a casket for cremation. If a funeral home
                offers cremation, it must also tell you that alternative
                containers are available. They may be out of unfinished wood,

                No state law requires embalming for every death. Some states
                require embalming or refrigeration if the body is not buried or
                cremated within a certain time; some states don&apos;t require it
                at all. In most cases, refrigeration or other cooling is an
                acceptable alternative. In addition, you may choose services like
                direct cremation and immediate burial, which don&apos;t require
                any form of preservation. Many funeral homes have a policy
                requiring embalming if the body is to be publicly viewed, but
                this is not required by law in most states. Ask if the funeral
                home offers private family viewing without embalming. If some
                form of preservation is a practical necessity, ask the funeral
                home if refrigeration is available.

          "What is a death doula, also called an end of life doula? A death doula is a professional companion who offers holistic, non-medical support to a dying person and their loved ones, providing emotional, spiritual and practical support to empower dignity and self-determination throughout the end of life and dying process. Death doulas can begin working with someone when death is very near or earlier. End of life doulas can: speak openly about dying and planning for death; discuss and record end-of-life care planning including advance directives; develop a plan for death including location, sounds, aromas; assist with physical and practical care; show how to care for, touch and speak to a dying person; provide respite for caregivers; explain the signs and symptoms of the dying process; assist with legacy projects and pre-death organization; provide spiritual support; assist with care and cleaning of a body following death; and guide people through the early stages of grieving.",

                A death doula is sitting at the kitchen table with a woman just
                after her husband has died at home. The hospice team visited
                yesterday but he died today with just his wife and the death
                doula at home. Now the doula is holding her hand, helping her
                take the small steps around what has to happen next; phone calls
                and such. The doula is also holding space for the woman to feel
                overwhelmed and in complete disbelief that her husband of 41
                years has just died.

                A brother and sister are planning a home funeral for their
                mother, who died at the hospital yesterday. Their death doula is
                helping to transform their living room into a space for vigil and
                memories, with dried flowers, fresh flowers, their mother&apos;s
                favorite handmade quilts and photographs. The doula is helping
                them prepare a space at one end of the living room for the pine
                casket that their uncle made for her, and will help them
                understand how to keep her body cooled once she is home in
                preparation for her funeral the following day.

                A death doula is working with a gentleman in his 90s. He hopes to
                leave certain items to his children and also write down a series
                of stories from his youth to be passed on to his children and
                grandchildren when he dies. His doula visits twice a week, each
                for three hours at a time. Together they gently go through his
                belongings, wrapping items he hopes to gift, and writing out
                cards for each. Items with no intended receiver are placed into a
                pile for donation, which the doula transports every month or so
                to the gentleman&apos;s favorite second hand shop. His doula also
                transcribes stories for him into a single file, and will have the
                file printed and bound for him when he decides it is ready. They
                enjoy reading over his stories after he has told them and editing
                together.

            <p>
              Costs for a death doula will vary significantly based on location
              and services provided. An hourly rate might range from $50 to $180
              per hour. Some doulas may offer packaged services, such as full
              support through and until a client&apos;s death. Others may charge
              a flat fee for 24-hour bedside vigils or for multiple days at the
              bedside when the end of life is near. Some doulas offer a sliding
              scale or pro bono (no cost) services to individuals in financial
              hardship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doula services are not currently covered by Medicare, Medicaid or
              private insurance in the US since they do not provide medical care.
              As such, doula services typically are paid directly by the client
              or their loved ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some hospice programs integrate death doula services into their
              selection of offerings, at no extra cost. Additionally, some long
              term care insurance policies may reimburse part of the cost of a
              death doula&apos;s services, so it is worth inquiring if an
              individual holds one of these policies.

        q: "Is hiring a death doula worth it?",
        a: "While the US medical system tends to focus on treating disease, death doula practice focuses on tending to the whole human being in their final months and moments. Doula work is rooted in ancient community care traditions. Doulas can offer a listening ear, continuity of presence, gentle guidance, physical and spiritual comfort, and a sense of dignity to a dying person. Many families find working with a doula deeply healing when a loved one passes, and find that a death doula has helped them approach death with grace rather than fear.",
