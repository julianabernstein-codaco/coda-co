#!/usr/bin/env node
// Build wrapper used by both `npm run build` and `npm run vercel-build`.
// Decides whether to run the Prisma chain based on env vars rather than
// the npm script name, so the same package.json works in CI (no DB), on
// Vercel (full chain), and locally without depending on Vercel's
// Project Settings → Build Command override being set correctly.
//
// Rules:
//   - DATABASE_URL unset (e.g. CI):  just `next build`
//   - DATABASE_URL set:              migrate + system seed, then build
//
// Preview deploys are no longer skipped: each preview gets its own
// Neon branch (via the Vercel-Neon integration) with a per-deployment
// DATABASE_URL, so migrate deploy applies against the branch and
// never touches production.
//
// Note: `db:mock` is intentionally NOT part of this chain — it wipes the
// DB and is only safe as a one-shot bootstrap. It was here temporarily
// for the initial Neon seed; the cleanup PR removed it so future
// deploys preserve real signups. If you need to re-bootstrap a fresh
// DB, either re-add it for one deploy or run `npm run db:mock`
// manually against the target DATABASE_URL.
