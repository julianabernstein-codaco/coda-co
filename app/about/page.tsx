              CodaCo Market was created out of a simple frustration: when
              facing the death of someone we love — or planning for our own —
              the resources we need are scattered, poorly described, and hard
              to compare.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that loss deserves to be met with care. When someone is
              grieving a loss or preparing for one, finding the right support
              shouldn&rsquo;t add to the weight they&rsquo;re already carrying.
            </p>
            <p>
              CodaCo Market exists to bring everything into one welcoming place:
              the goods and services that help families navigate loss, make sense
              of death and dying, and honor the people they love.
