              The very first thing to do when someone dies is to take time to
              breathe. You have time to sit. You have time to call another loved
              one. There is no emergency now.

              There is a lot to take care of when someone dies, but you are
              allowed to grieve. You are allowed to be confused, and
              overwhelmed, and a mess.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grief has no timeline and affects each of us differently. There is
              no one way to grieve, just as there is no one way to love someone.

              After someone dies, their life must be legally and
              administratively closed out. The many, many tasks that need to be
              done when someone dies are together stressful, bureaucratic work.
              These tasks can take months to years to complete, often while
              complicated by grief. The most important thing to remember is that
              when someone has died, it is not an immediate emergency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some things need to take place in the first 24 hours after death,
              but nothing needs to happen in the first few minutes. When
              you&apos;re ready, read on for more details.

              This is a popular alternative to &lsquo;traditional burial.&rsquo;
              In a green burial, a body is placed in its natural state (no
              embalming) into a biodegradable casket or natural fiber shroud.
              The body is then placed directly into the earth, allowing it to
              decompose naturally. Green burials are legal in all 50 US states,
              though there are some regulations around where they can take
              place. Many states have green burial cemeteries or &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo;
              cemeteries which offer both traditional and green burials.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-medium text-ch">Traditional Burial:</span>{" "}
              A traditional burial may include embalming (where blood is drained
              from a body and replaced with formaldehyde or other chemicals for
              preservation), a casket (wooden, metal, other) and a grave is
              generally lined with concrete (forming the burial vault) before
              the body is laid to rest. Temporarily delays decomposition,
              keeping the body intact for several days or up to a week.

              Protection Agency and must take place at least three nautical
              miles from shore. There are several rules around body and casket
              preparation for burial at sea, and the EPA must be notified of a
              burial within 30 days following the event. More information about

              In traditional cremation, a body is incinerated (burned) and the
              remaining bone fragments are crushed into ashes. Ashes can then be
              returned to loved ones to be buried, kept in an urn, and/or

              Terramation is a process that allows for natural decomposition in
              urban areas, where green cemeteries and natural burial may not be
              readily available. In this process, bodies are laid to rest within
              a closed vessel along with organic material (such as straw,
              alfalfa and wood chips) to transform into nutrient-rich soil over
              several weeks. The soil can then be returned to loved ones to be

              Aquamation is a process that uses water and an alkaline solution

              organizations for scientific study and medical training. Most
              programs will cover the costs of transportation, cremation after
              study, and the return of ashes to the family.

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              While laws around the transport and disposition of human bodies
              varies by state, there is a federal Funeral Rule in place to
              protect the consumer who is planning and paying for a funeral.
              These rules exist to protect people from unfair upselling and
              unclear pricing structures at a funeral home and are enforced by
              the Federal Trade Commission. The Funeral Rule makes it possible
              for you to choose only the goods and services from a funeral home
              that you want or need. The rule allows you to compare prices
              between funeral homes and makes it possible to select arrangements
              you want to use for a home funeral. In short, you do not have to
              buy a package, and you do not have to use a funeral home if you
              prefer a home funeral.
            </p>
            <p>The US Funeral Rule gives you the right to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

                You have a protected right to buy separate goods (such as
                caskets) and services (such as embalming or a memorial service).
                You do not have to accept a package that includes any items you
                do not want.

                Funeral directors are required to give you pricing information
                over the telephone if you ask for it, and you do not need to
                give them your name, telephone number or address first. Some
                funeral homes will mail their price lists, and some post them

                The funeral home must give you a General Price List that is yours

                It can be overwhelming to shop for a casket. Funerals must

                Outer burial containers, such as concrete vaults lining a grave,

                general price list, you have the right to look at a separate
                container price list before you see the containers. If you
                don&apos;t see the lower-priced containers listed, ask about

                This statement should show exactly what you are buying and the

                You may use an alternative container. No state or local law
                requires the use of a casket for cremation. If a funeral home

                No state law requires embalming for every death. Some states
                require embalming or refrigeration if the body is not buried or
                cremated within a certain time; some states don&apos;t require it
                at all. In most cases, refrigeration or other cooling is an
                acceptable alternative. In addition, you may choose services like
                direct cremation and immediate burial, which don&apos;t require
                any form of preservation. Many funeral homes have a policy
                requiring embalming if the body is to be publicly viewed, but
                this is not required by law in most states. Ask if the funeral
                home offers private family viewing without embalming. If some
                form of preservation is a practical necessity, ask the funeral
                home if refrigeration is available.

          "What are the rules around funerals where I live? Laws around transport and disposition of human bodies vary by state, but there is a federal Funeral Rule enforced by the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers from unfair upselling and unclear pricing at a funeral home. You do not have to buy a package or use a funeral home if you prefer a home funeral. The US Funeral Rule gives you the right to: buy only the funeral arrangements you want; hear price information over the telephone; receive a written itemized General Price List when you visit a funeral home; see a written casket price list before you see the actual caskets; get a price list for outer burial containers and concrete vaults; receive a written statement before you pay; choose cremation without buying a casket and use an alternative container of unfinished wood, fiberboard or cardboard; provide the funeral home with a casket or urn you buy elsewhere without a fee. Embalming is never required; refrigeration is often an acceptable alternative; direct cremation and immediate burial require no preservation.

              A death doula, also known as an end-of-life doula, is a
              professional companion who offers holistic, non-medical support to
              a dying person and their loved ones. Doulas provide emotional,

              self-determination throughout the end of life and dying process.
              Death doulas can begin working with someone when death is very

                and such. The doula is also holding space for the woman to feel

                memories, with dried flowers, fresh flowers, their mother&apos;s
                favorite handmade quilts and photographs. The doula is helping
                them prepare a space at one end of the living room for the pine
                casket that their uncle made for her, and will help them
                understand how to keep her body cooled once she is home in

                A death doula is working with a gentleman in his 90s. He hopes to
                leave certain items to his children and also write down a series
                of stories from his youth to be passed on to his children and
                grandchildren when he dies. His doula visits twice a week, each
                for three hours at a time. Together they gently go through his
                belongings, wrapping items he hopes to gift, and writing out
                cards for each. Items with no intended receiver are placed into a
                pile for donation, which the doula transports every month or so
                to the gentleman&apos;s favorite second hand shop. His doula also
                transcribes stories for him into a single file, and will have the
                file printed and bound for him when he decides it is ready. They
                enjoy reading over his stories after he has told them and editing
                together.

              Costs for a death doula will vary significantly based on location
              and services provided. An hourly rate might range from $50 to $180
              per hour. Some doulas may offer packaged services, such as full
              support through and until a client&apos;s death. Others may charge
              a flat fee for 24-hour bedside vigils or for multiple days at the
              bedside when the end of life is near. Some doulas offer a sliding

              hardship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doula services are not currently covered by Medicare, Medicaid or
              private insurance in the US since they do not provide medical care.
              As such, doula services typically are paid directly by the client

              Some hospice programs integrate death doula services into their
              selection of offerings, at no extra cost. Additionally, some long
              term care insurance policies may reimburse part of the cost of a

              Absolutely not. Hospice is redefining what hope looks like.
              Instead of focusing on curing an illness, hospice focuses on

              together, reduces stress, and improves day-to-day comfort.
              Research has also shown that hospice care does not shorten life

              sometimes longer than—those receiving aggressive treatments near

          "Can hospice care be provided at home? Yes. In fact, most hospice care takes place wherever the patient calls home. The hospice team visits regularly and works closely with family caregivers to create a plan of care. This allows many people to remain in familiar surroundings while receiving professional support, symptom management, medical equipment, and help whenever it's needed.",

              If someone decides they want to pursue treatment again or their
              goals change, they can leave hospice at any time. If a
              person&apos;s condition improves, they may no longer qualify and

              While eligibility is reviewed regularly, hospice care can continue
              well beyond six months as long as a patient continues to meet the
              necessary criteria.

        a: "It's a philosophy called döstädning in Swedish — a thoughtful, intentional way of going through a person's belongings, keeping what truly matters and finding good homes for the rest. Despite the name, it's really not morbid. It's actually quite loving.",
